## TOPIC 4 – SWITCH STATEMENT IN C++

Switch is another way of decision making, but more structured than multiple if-else.

---

## 1. Concept (What is switch?)

`switch` is used when:

* You want to check ONE variable
* Against MULTIPLE fixed values

It replaces long chains of:

```
if (x == 1)
else if (x == 2)
else if (x == 3) ...
```

---

## 2. Why switch is needed?

Problems with multiple if-else:
• Hard to read
• Messy code
• Less structured

Switch provides:
• Cleaner code
• Better readability
• Faster understanding

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

```cpp
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;

    case value2:
        // code
        break;

    default:
        // code
}
```

Important:

* Expression is usually int or char
* break stops execution of further cases

---

## 4. Basic Example

```cpp
int day = 3;

switch(day) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Monday";
        break;

    case 2:
        cout << "Tuesday";
        break;

    case 3:
        cout << "Wednesday";
        break;

    default:
        cout << "Invalid day";
}
```

Output:

```
Wednesday
```

---

## 5. Flow Dry Run

day = 3

Check:
case 1 → no
case 2 → no
case 3 → yes → prints "Wednesday"
break → exit switch

---

## 6. Importance of break

If you forget break:

```cpp
int x = 2;

switch(x) {
    case 1:
        cout << "One";
    case 2:
        cout << "Two";
    case 3:
        cout << "Three";
}
```

Output:

```
TwoThree
```

Because execution "falls through" to next cases.

---

## 7. default case

Runs when no case matches.

```cpp
switch(choice) {
    case 1: cout << "Add"; break;
    case 2: cout << "Subtract"; break;
    default: cout << "Invalid choice";
}
```

---

## 8. Switch vs If-Else

| switch                | if-else                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Best for fixed values | Best for ranges             |
| Cleaner for menus     | Good for complex conditions |
| Faster readability    | More flexible               |

Use switch when:

* Checking single variable
* Against exact values

---

## 9. Practical Example (Menu system)

```cpp
int choice;
cin >> choice;

switch(choice) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Play Game";
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "Settings";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Exit";
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid Option";
}
```

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

1. Forgetting break
2. Using float/double in switch (not allowed)
3. Expecting range logic inside switch

This is wrong:

```
case x > 5:  ❌
```

---

## Mini Practice

1. Input a number (1-7) and print day of week
2. Calculator using switch (+, -, *, /)
3. Traffic light system (1=Red, 2=Yellow, 3=Green)

---

## Interview Quick Points

• switch checks fixed constant values
• break stops case execution
• default handles unmatched values
• Better for menu-driven programs
