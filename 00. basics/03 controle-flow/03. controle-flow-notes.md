Good. Now we move into **decision making** – the brain of any program.

==============================

## TOPIC 3 – IF ELSE STATEMENTS IN C++

This is what allows your program to **think and choose**.

---

## 1. Concept (What is if-else?)

`if-else` allows the program to execute code based on a condition.

Real life example:
If it is raining → take umbrella
Else → go without umbrella

Same logic in C++.

---

## 2. Why is if-else needed?

Without if-else:

* Program always runs in straight line.
* No decisions, no logic, no intelligence.

With if-else:

* Program reacts to different inputs.
* Dynamic behaviour becomes possible.

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code runs when condition is true
}
else {
    // code runs when condition is false
}
```

Condition always gives:

* true or
* false

---

## 4. Simple Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age;
    cin >> age;

    if (age >= 18) {
        cout << "Eligible to vote";
    }
    else {
        cout << "Not eligible to vote";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Input:

```
16
```

Output:

```
Not eligible to vote
```

---

## 5. Flow Understanding

Suppose:
age = 20

Check:
age >= 18 → true
So IF block runs
ELSE is skipped completely.

---

## 6. if - else if - else (Multiple conditions)

Used when more than 2 conditions exist.

Syntax:

```cpp
if (condition1) {
}
else if (condition2) {
}
else {
}
```

Example: Marks grading

```cpp
int marks;
cin >> marks;

if (marks >= 90)
    cout << "Grade A";
else if (marks >= 75)
    cout << "Grade B";
else if (marks >= 50)
    cout << "Grade C";
else
    cout << "Fail";
```

---

## 7. Comparison Operators

Used inside conditions:

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| >        | greater          |
| <        | smaller          |
| >=       | greater or equal |
| <=       | smaller or equal |
| ==       | equal            |
| !=       | not equal        |

Example:

```
if (x == 10)
if (y != 0)
```

---

## 8. Logical Operators

For multiple conditions

| Operator | Meaning |   |    |
| -------- | ------- | - | -- |
| &&       | AND     |   |    |
|          |         |   | OR |
| !        | NOT     |   |    |

Examples:

```cpp
if (age >= 18 && age <= 60)
```

```cpp
if (day == "Sunday" || day == "Saturday")
```

---

## 9. Nested if-else

if inside another if.

```cpp
if (age >= 18) {
    if (age < 60)
        cout << "Working age";
    else
        cout << "Senior citizen";
}
else {
    cout << "Minor";
}
```

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

1. Using = instead of ==

```
if (x = 5)   // WRONG
if (x == 5)  // CORRECT
```

2. Missing braces causing logic issues

3. Too many nested ifs → hard to read

---

## Real Dry Run Example

Code:

```cpp
int x = 5;

if (x > 10)
    cout << "A";
else if (x > 3)
    cout << "B";
else
    cout << "C";
```

Dry run:
x = 5
5 > 10 ❌
5 > 3 ✅
Output = B

---

## Mini Practice

1. Input a number and check if it is positive, negative, or zero
2. Check if a person is eligible for driving (age >= 18)
3. Input marks and print grade

---

## Interview Quick Points

• if checks a condition
• else runs when condition fails
• else if allows multiple conditions
• Conditions return boolean
• == is for comparison
